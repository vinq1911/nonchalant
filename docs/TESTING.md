# Testing

## Unit Tests

Run unit tests with:
```
make test
```

Or directly:
```
go test ./...
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify server startup, health checks, and graceful shutdown:
```
make itest
```

Integration tests:
- Build the server binary
- Start it on a free port
- Wait for /healthz endpoint
- Send SIGINT
- Verify clean shutdown within 2 seconds

## Test Targets

- make test - Run all unit tests
- make test-short - Run short tests only
- make test-race - Run tests with race detector
- make bench - Run benchmarks
- make itest - Run integration tests
- make itest-clean - Clean integration test artifacts
